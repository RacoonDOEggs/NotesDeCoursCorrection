## Factors

### $K_v$ : Dynamic Factor
Dynamic factor $K_v$ accounts for the internally generated vibration loads (additional loads) from tooth to tooth impact due to non-conjugate meshing of gear teeth.

This factor depends on the Gear Quality Index ($Q_v$) and the Pitch line velocity.

If the actual dynamic loading to transmission error such as shaft misalignment, bearing misalignment, stiffness of the structure supporting the bearing can be taken into account by increasing the tangential load $W_t$ then $K_v$ can be set to 1.


### $Q_v$ : Gear quality index
AGMA quality number and represents the quality of gear in terms of the geometric accuracy of the teeth. Quality numbers from lowest quality Q3 to Highest quality Q16. It represent the accuracy of the tooth geometry; the higher the quality number the smaller the tolerance.
#### Parameters:
**The tooth lead or tooth alignment** criterion applies to spur and helical-type gearing and measures the variation between the specified lead (or helix angle) and the lead of the produced gear.    
  
**Involute profile variation** is the difference between the specified profile and the measured profile of the tooth.  

**Pitch variation or spacing variation** is the difference between the specified tooth location and the actual tooth location around the circumference of the gear.  

**Radial runout** refers to the disparity in radial position of teeth on a gear – the variation in tooth distances from the center of rotation.

#### Tolerances for each $Q_v$
